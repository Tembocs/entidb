# .pubignore for entidb_flutter
# This file specifies what should be excluded when publishing to pub.dev
# Unlike .gitignore, we WANT to include the native binaries

# Standard excludes
.dart_tool/
.packages
build/
*.iml

# Test files (not needed in published package)
test/

# Development files
.idea/
*.log

# NOTE: We explicitly do NOT exclude native libraries (*.dll, *.so, *.dylib, *.a, *.xcframework)
# because they need to be bundled with the package for end users
